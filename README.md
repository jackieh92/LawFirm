# LawFirm Project
_By: Jacqueline, Alexandra, and Celeste_

This Project was done using solely HTML and CSS.  The goal was to produce a mock Law Website</br> 
that mimicked an already existing site in an attempt to practice CSS and HTML. </br>
We worked as a team and divvied up the tasks into three htmls:</br>

* whoweare
* whatwedo
* index

The plan for CSS was for each page to have their own CSS but put the code in one file known as "main.CSS"
